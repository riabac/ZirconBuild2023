            <p>In 2001, Richard and his partner Zoe, established a property refurbishment company, acquiring dilapidated period properties around Birmingham and sympathetically renovating them for sale. This led to the formation of Zircon Design and Build which was incorporated as a Limited Company in 2008.  Richard is employed full time by the company working on a wide variety of domestic building projects in Kings Heath and Moseley. The company continues to thrive in a competitive environment.  </p>
            <p>In 2008 we were nominated by Building Control at Birmingham City Council for their ’Built in Quality’ Award for residential builders producing work of a consistently high standard. </p>
            <p> Richard has worked in the construction and civil engineering industries for over 30 years after completing an HND in Building Studies in 1986 and a 3 year part-time bricklaying course at South Birmingham Technical College in 2001. </p>
            <p>He spent 3 years working with Wates Construction in Birmingham on various projects including the facade retention scheme at Louisa Ryland House for Birmingham City Council. Employment also included working for Balfour Beatty on Hall 2 of the International Convention Centre and for Henry Boot on the Birmingham Law Courts. He spent 10 years working on civil engineering projects in the UK and USA. </p>
            <p>Zoe has a background in design and has been directly involved in many of our projects. She can assist clients in identifying the best use of space, designing bespoke doors and windows and, if required, advise on kitchens, bathrooms, lighting and final finishes.</p>
